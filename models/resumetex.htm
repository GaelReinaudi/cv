<p>
ResumeTeX uses LaTeX and BibTeX to generate a resume or cv (curriculum
vitae) as a postscript or pdf file. ResumeTeX is still a work in
progress so if you use this code, check back here for updates. To use
ResumeTeX you need to already know how to use LaTeX (see "A Guide to
Latex" by Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly published by Addison-Wesley,
3rd edition 1999.) and BibTeX (see "BibTeXing" by Oren Patashnik
February 8, 1988).
</p>

<p>TODO: Yes I know that this page is ugly and hard to read. This needs
to be fixed later. This page contains some comments on ResumeTeX, but
if you understand LaTeX and BibTex the sample files below should be
enough documentation. At some point in the future when I have time, I
would like to fully document this code and upload it to <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a>.</p>

<p>The advantages of using this code is that it separates your resume
data from the formatting, and it makes it easy to change your resume
without retyping your data. This code is something I wrote (for fun?)
in about three weeks to use for creating my own resume, since I wanted
my resume to be in pdf format. Since I find that I often need to change
my resume depending on where I submit it to, I wanted to create a
system that would allow me to easily change my resume without
constantly retyping and deleting information in my resume. I'm pretty
happy with it. Please email me (sagerj@acm.org) if you find any bugs or
have comments on how it works.</p>

<h2>ResumeTeX Files</h2>
These files are the backbone of ResumeTeX.<br>

<h2>Example Personal Information Files</h2>These files hold your
personal information. I have placed my publications in a separate
file--this isn't necessay. I've done this so that I can use
publications.bib with normal latex documents for paper writing.<br>

<h2>ResumeTeX Style Files</h2>
These files apply a style to your resume data.<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Esagerj/resumetex/resumetex_format1.sty">resumetex_format1.sty</a>. Example resume: <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Esagerj/resumetex/resume_format1.pdf">resume_format1.pdf</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Esagerj/resumetex/resumetex_format2.sty">resumetex_formate2.sty</a>. Example resume: <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Esagerj/resumetex/resume_format2.pdf">resume_format2.pdf</a><br>

<h2>Additional TeX Packages</h2>
I use CurVe to help with formatting in my style files.<br>
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/info?id=curve">CurVe</a><br>

<h2>How to use ResumeTeX:</h2>

<p>
Download resumetex.bst (BibTeX file for ResumeTeX entries),
resumetex.cls (LaTeX ResumeTeX document class), and at least one of the
resumetex_formatXxx.sty files (LaTeX ResumeTeX style package). You also
need the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/info?id=curve">CurVe TeX package</a>, availble from <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">ctan.org</a>.
You will need to create a .tex and a .bib file for your own information
simular to the examples above. Optionally you can create your own style
package to customize the style of your resume.
</p>

<h2>Creating a postscript or pdf file</h2>

To compile I use this sequence of commands:
<pre>latex resume;
bibtex resume;
latex resume;
latex resume;
dvips -t letter -f resume.dvi &gt; resume.ps;
ps2pdf resume.ps;
</pre>The first time that you call latex, you will get a lot of errors
about undefined commands. This is not a bug. The second time you run
latex there shouldn't be errors (if there are errors the second time
then this is a bug).
<h2>Components of the .bib file</h2>**WARNING: THE CITATION LABELS CAN
ONLY BE COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS.** For example your label can be
"@job{UNMJob, ..." but not "@job{UNMJob2005, ...". (This is because my
system makes LaTeX commands out of the citation labels, and LaTeX
commands can only be letters.)
Types of entries:<br>

<pre>@goal</pre>
    description: Entry for resume goal.<br>
    required fields: description<br>
<pre>@academicschool</pre>
    description: Entry for a school.<br>
    required fields: school, location, date, degree, description<br>
    optional fields: TODO: make degree optional<br>
<pre>@job</pre>
    description: Entry for a job<br>
    required fields: title, company, location, date, supervisor, description<br>
    optional fields: TODO: make supervisor optional<br>
<pre>@skill</pre>
    description: Entry for a skill<br>
    required fields: title, description,<br>
<pre>@reference</pre>
    description: Entry for a reference<br>
    required fields: name, address<br>
    optional fields: TODO: make address optional<br>
<pre>@article, @book, @booklet, @inbook, @incollection, @inproceedings, @conference, @manual, @mastersthesis, @misc, @phdthesis, @proceedings, @techreport, and @unpublished</pre>
    For these standard BibTeX entries see a description of unsrt.bib for the required and optional fields.

<h2>Components of the .tex file</h2>

<pre>\documentclass{resumetex}  % sets the document class to ResumeTeX

% include one of the ResumeTeX style packages or your own ResumeTeX style package
\usepackage{resumetex_format1}  % uncomment this to use the resumetex_format1 style
%\usepackage{resumetex_format2}  % uncomment this to use the resumetex_format2 style

% ------ Address --------------------------------------------------------

\leftheader{\href{mailto:sagerj@acm.org}{\texttt{sagerj@acm.org}}}
\rightheader{\url{http://www.cs.unm.edu/~sagerj}}
\title{Jennifer A. Sager}
\subtitle{}

% ------ Document --------------------------------------------------------

\begin{document}

% The strange placement of these commands at the beginning of the document is important!
% create citations for all the entries in the bibliography from resume.bib and publications.bib
\resumedata{resume,publications}
\input{resume.bbl}

\makeheaders[t]
\maketitle

% each rubric must be in a separate file
% syntax: \makerubric{filename} where the filename does not include the extension
\makerubric{goal}
\makerubric{experience}
\makerubric{education}
\makerubric{publications}
\makerubric{skills}
\makerubric{software}
\makerubric{references}

\end{document}
</pre>
Each rubric resides in a separate file.
The body is composed of LaTeX code and the following commands: rubric
enviroment and commands created from the bibliography entries:
For example:
<pre>\begin{rubric}{Education}  % creates a rubric with the title "Education"
\UNM    % inserts the UNM entry from the bibligraphy
\CSSS   % inserts the CSSS entry from the bibligraphy
\UPenn  % inserts the UPenn entry from the bibligraphy
\end{rubric}  % ends the Education rubric
</pre>The commands such as \UNM, \CSSS, and \UPenn are determined by
the tags in the bibliography file. They must use the same
capitalization as in the bib file, and must be valid latex commands (so
they can't contain numbers, dashes, etc.).
As a side note: the publication bib and other resume bibs do not need
to be in seperate files. I've done it this way so that I can reuse my
publications bibliography for citations in papers that I write.
Also note that additional latex code can be inserted anywhere in the
body of your .tex document, even in between rubric environment
commands.
<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<h3>style</h3>

Most of the hard work about formating the text is done by CurVe.  The .sty files just customize CurVe.

<h3>resumetex.bst</h3>

<p>This file is based on the standard BibTeX file: unsrt.bib, but a few
modifications have been made. Unlike normal BibTex, resumetex.bst
generates latex commands from the tag of each cited entry. This is the
reason why the bibliography is declared at the beginning of the
document--we need to define these commands so that we can use them in
the rest of the document. This is a bit of a strange way of using
BibTeX, but I wanted to create a resume class that allows latex
commands to be intermixed with the BibTeX commands that determine how
the bibliography looks. If I just made ResumeTeX format a section
simular to BibTeX's normal "References" section, then it would create a
file that would be inserted in to the .tex file at a certain point and
the user could not intermix latex commands.
</p>

<p>Each tag command calls a latex function determined by the type of
tag. The program expects certain functions to be defined when it
creates a citation for a bib entry--in ResumeTeX these functions are
defined in the .sty files. This enables the user to specify the style
of the resume in latex in the .sty files rather than BibTeX's
postscript like language (glug!). If the style file implements all of
the functions defined below, then the style of a single .tex file can
be easily changed by changing the package that is included.</p>

@goal entries formats its fields by calling the \goal function with the following arguments
<pre>%\goal
%   {#1 description}
</pre>

@job entries formats its fields by calling the \job function with the following arguments
<pre>% \job
%   {#1 title}
%   {#2 company}
%   {#3 location}
%   {#4 date}
%   {#5 supervisor}
%   {#6 description}
</pre>

@degree entries formats its fields by calling the \degree function with the following arguments
<pre>% \degree
%   {#1 school}
%   {#2 location}
%   {#3 degree}
%   {#4 date}
%   {#5 description}
</pre>

@skill entries formats its fields by calling the \skill function with the following arguments
<pre>% \skill
%   {#1 name}
%   {#2 description}
</pre>

@reference entries formats its fields by calling the \reference function with the following arguments
<pre>% \reference
%   {#1 name}
%   {#2 address}
</pre>

@publication entries formats its fields by calling the \publication function with the following arguments
<pre>% \publication
%   {#1 description}
</pre>
The \publication function allows some customization of the style of
publications, but most of the formatting is done by the code taken from
unsrt.bib. If you want to make major changes to the publication style,
you are going to have to make your own .bst file.
<p>
The following latex commands can be defined to change the font used for the title:<br>
\authornamefont: The font used to print the author's name<br>
\authoraddressfont: the font used to print the author's address<br>
\authoremailfont: the font used to print the author's email<br>
\authorwebsitefont: the font used to print the author's website<br>The
formatting of the title section can also be changed by redefining the
relevant commands in a style file (look at the file resumetex.cls to
see which commands need to be redefined to do this).
</p>

<p>Another modication to unsrt.bib that has been made is to disallow
latex to simplify entries using crossreferencing. Note that the
crossing referencing tag is still allowed. This point is probably best
explained with an example. consider the following bib entries:
</p><pre>@inproceedings{SagerPreproceedingsOfDNAEleven,
author = {Jennifer A. Sager and Darko Stefanovic},
title = {Designing Nucleotide Sequences for Computation: A Survey of Constraints},
crossref = "PRELIMINARYPROCEEDINGSINTERNATIONALDNAELEVEN"
}

@proceedings{PRELIMINARYPROCEEDINGSINTERNATIONALDNAELEVEN,
key = "PRELIMINARYPROCEEDINGSINTERNATIONALDNAELEVEN",
editor = {A. Carbone and M. Daley and L. Kari and I. McQuillan and N. Pierce},
title = {Preliminary Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on DNA-Based Computers, DNA 2005 (University of Western Ontario: London, Ontario, Canada)},
booktitle = {Preliminary Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on DNA-Based Computers, DNA 2005 (University of Western Ontario: London, Ontario, Canada)},
year = 2005,
month = jun
}
</pre>Under certain conditions BibTeX may decide to cite
SagerPreproceedingsOfDNAEleven with a reference to the
PRELIMINARYPROCEEDINGSINTERNATIONALDNAELEVEN citation. Under other
conditions BibTeX will cite SagerPreproceedingsOfDNAEleven with the
information from PRELIMINARYPROCEEDINGSINTERNATIONALDNAELEVEN inserted
directly as text. Since ResumeTeX does not use citation numbers, it can
only have the second type of crossreferencing. Thus, code relevant to
the first senario in unsrt.bib has been commented out.
<p></p>

<p>resumetex.bst is also the file which describes the required and
optional fields for the entries @goal, @academicschool, @job, @skill,
@reference. If you need to add new tags or change the fields, then this
file is where these modifications need to be made, however you will
have to program this in BibTex's postscript like langage. For
information about programming in BibTeX see section 5 of "Designing
BibTeX Styles" by Oren Patashnik.
</p>

<h3>resumetex_format1.sty and resumetex_format2.sty</h3>These files
impose some sort of text formatting on how the entries in the .bib file
are displayed. Making a new one of these files is the easiest way to
change how your resume looks.
